# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

### Building the App
```bash
# Build the Xcode project
xcodebuild -project Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj -scheme Anchor build

# Or using Xcode Build MCP tools
# Use scheme "Anchor" and workspace path "Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests
xcodebuild -project Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj -scheme Anchor test

# Run specific test target
xcodebuild -project Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj -scheme AnchorTests test
```

### Building the AnchorKit Package
```bash
# From the AnchorKit directory
cd Anchor/AnchorKit
swift build
swift test
```

## Project Architecture

### High-Level Structure

Anchor is a macOS menubar app for location-based check-ins to Bluesky using the AT Protocol. The project uses a modular architecture with two main components:

- **Anchor (Main App)**: SwiftUI-based menubar application
- **AnchorKit**: Reusable business logic package for potential iOS/watchOS expansion

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Shared Business Logic**: AnchorKit contains all models, services, and utilities that could be reused across platforms
2. **MenuBarExtra Pattern**: Uses SwiftUI's MenuBarExtra for native macOS menubar integration
3. **Observable Pattern**: LocationService uses @Observable for reactive UI updates
4. **Async/Await**: Modern Swift concurrency throughout location and networking code

### Core Models

- **Place**: Represents OpenStreetMap POIs with element type/ID, coordinates, and tags
- **AnchorSettings**: User preferences stored in UserDefaults with immutable update methods
- **AuthCredentials**: Bluesky authentication data with automatic storage and validation

### Services Architecture

- **LocationService**: CoreLocation wrapper with proper permission handling for menubar apps
- **OverpassService**: OpenStreetMap POI discovery via Overpass API
- **BlueskyService**: AT Protocol authentication and posting to Bluesky

### Location Permission Strategy

The menubar app architecture solves critical location permission issues that CLI apps face on macOS. The LocationService is designed specifically for MenuBarExtra apps where permission dialogs work properly.

## Development Notes

### Platform Requirements
- macOS 14.0+ (declared in project settings)
- Swift 6.0+ with strict concurrency
- Xcode 15.0+ for development

### Key Dependencies
- No external dependencies - uses built-in frameworks only
- SwiftUI for UI
- CoreLocation for geolocation
- Foundation for data models

### Testing Strategy

#### Framework & Architecture
- **Swift Testing**: Modern declarative testing framework (migrated from XCTest)
- **Unit tests**: Comprehensive business logic testing in AnchorKit package
- **Integration tests**: Network-dependent tests for external APIs (Overpass, Bluesky)
- **UI tests**: Menubar app functionality testing in AnchorUITests
- **Dependency injection**: Protocol-based testing with URLSession mocking for network services

#### Test Organization & Tags
Tests are organized with semantic tags for filtering and categorization:
- `.unit` - Fast unit tests for models and utilities
- `.integration` - Tests requiring network access or external services
- `.services` - Service layer testing (BlueskyService, FeedService, OverpassService)
- `.models` - Data model testing (Place, ATProtoRecord, AuthCredentials)
- `.auth` - Authentication and credential management tests
- `.feed` - Feed parsing and AT Protocol record processing
- `.network` - Network-dependent tests (can be filtered out for offline development)
- `.location` - Location-based functionality tests
- `.markdown` - Markdown formatting and rich text processing
- `.facets` - AT Protocol facet and rich text feature tests

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests (47 tests total)
swift test

# Run specific test categories
swift test --filter .unit          # Fast unit tests only
swift test --filter .integration   # Integration tests only
swift test --filter .services      # Service layer tests
swift test --filter .network       # Network-dependent tests

# Run from Xcode project (includes UI tests)
xcodebuild -project Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj -scheme Anchor test
```

#### Test Coverage
- **ATProtoRecord**: Markdown formatting, facet processing, timeline data conversion
- **FeedService**: Feed fetching, filtering, error handling with URLSession mocking
- **BlueskyService**: Rich text facet generation, check-in text formatting, URL/mention/hashtag detection
- **OverpassService**: POI discovery, query building, API integration
- **Core Models**: Place creation, ID parsing, settings management, credential validation

#### Testing Best Practices
- **Parameterized testing**: Using Swift Testing's arguments for comprehensive edge case coverage
- **Async/await support**: Proper handling of async service methods with MainActor isolation
- **Mocking**: Protocol-based dependency injection for URLSession and external services
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error scenario testing for network failures and invalid data
- **Unicode support**: Proper UTF-8 byte counting for AT Protocol facet range calculations

### Menubar App Specifics
- Uses `.menuBarExtraStyle(.window)` for proper window presentation
- Frame size: 320x400 pixels for optimal menubar experience
- Includes quit button since app doesn't appear in dock
